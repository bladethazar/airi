# AIRI - Autonomous Intelligent Reactive Interface

**AIRI** (Autonomous Intelligent Reactive Interface) is a modular, AI-driven vehicle assistant developed for a 2016 Subaru WRX STI. Inspired by KITT (Knight Rider), AIRI blends modern AI technology with Japanese engineering aesthetics.  
AIRI is designed as an autonomous and personal co-pilot, offering voice interaction, real-time vehicle data visualization, and adaptive learning behavior.

## üö¶ Communication Flow

[Android Headunit]
   ‚áÑ Voice Commands (Whisper STT)
   ‚áÑ UI Feedback from AIRI

[ESP32 NodeMCU]
   ‚áÑ Sends OBD2 Telemetry to AIRI WebSocket Server
   ‚áÑ Optional: Sensor Data (Temp, Accel, GPS)

[ROG X13 - AIRI]
   ‚áÑ Runs LLM (Mistral) + AIRI Persona
   ‚áÑ Receives voice input, telemetry, and processes actions
   ‚áÑ Sends data to K3s InfluxDB

## üöô OBD2 Integration

The **OBD2 Adapter** connects to the vehicle's **CAN Bus** to capture real-time telemetry data, including vehicle speed, RPM, engine temperature, and other critical diagnostics. The data is sent via **ESP32** to the AIRI AI server, which processes it and offers insights, updates, and visualizations through the Android Headunit UI.

### Key OBD2 Data:

- Vehicle Speed (mph/kmh)
- Engine RPM
- Throttle Position
- Fuel Level
- Engine Temperature
- DTC (Diagnostic Trouble Codes)

This data is captured by the **ESP32 NodeMCU** via the OBD2 interface and transmitted in **JSON** format over **WebSocket** to the **ROG X13**, where AIRI processes it.
